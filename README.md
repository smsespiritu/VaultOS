This is just the Backend part, there are three Endpoints:
1. Register User with Service Type
2. Retrieve User by Id
3. Retrieve all users
4. Get Lead by Service Type

Get All Leads can be coded using the front end. (Consolidate per Service Type calling the same getLead(svcType) endpoint.)

This is following a Model and Controller Framework.

Built using CodeSnack IDE on mobile, currently using express js serverless.
